Our approach constructs a directed graph that can be efﬁciently explored for nearest neighbour queries. Each vertex in this graph represents a feature vector from the dataset being searched. The directed edges are computed by exploiting the fact that, for these datasets, the intrinsic dimensionality of the local manifold-like structure formed by the elements of the dataset is signiﬁcantly lower than the embedding space. We also provide an efﬁcient search algorithm that uses this graph to rapidly ﬁnd the nearest neighbour to a query with high probability.},

  title    = {Approximate {Nearest} {Neighbor} {Queries} in {Fixed} {Dimensions}},
  abstract = {Given a set of n points in d-dimensional Euclidean space, S ⊂ Ed, and a query point q ∈ Ed, we wish to determine the nearest neighbor of q, that is, the point of S whose Euclidean distance to q is minimum. The goal is to preprocess the point set S, such that queries can be answered as eﬃciently as possible. We assume that the dimension d is a constant independent of n. Although reasonably good solutions to this problem exist when d is small, as d increases the performance of these algorithms degrades rapidly. We present a randomized algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor searching. Given any set of n points S ⊂ Ed, and a constant {\textgreater} 0, we produce a data structure, such that given any query point, a point of S will be reported whose distance from the query point is at most a factor of (1 + ) from that of the true nearest neighbor. Our algorithm runs in O(log3 n) expected time and requires O(n log n) space. The data structure can be built in O(n2) expected time. The constant factors depend on d and . Because of the practical importance of nearest neighbor searching in higher dimensions, we have implemented a practical variant of this algorithm, and show empirically that for many point distributions this variant of the algorithm ﬁnds the nearest neighbor in moderately large dimension signiﬁcantly faster than existing practical approaches.},

  abstract = {The world has experienced phenomenal growth in data production and storage in recent years, much of which has taken the form of media files. At the same time, computing power has become abundant with multi-core machines, grids, and clouds. Yet it remains a challenge to harness the available power and move toward gracefully searching and retrieving from web-scale media collections. Several researchers have experimented with using automatically distributed computing frameworks, notably Hadoop and Spark, for processing multimedia material, but mostly using small collections on small computing clusters. In this article, we describe a prototype of a (near) web-scale throughput-oriented MM retrieval service using the Spark framework running on the AWS cloud service. We present retrieval results using up to 43 billion SIFT feature vectors from the public YFCC 100M collection, making this the largest high-dimensional feature vector collection reported in the literature. We also present a publicly available demonstration retrieval system, running on our own servers, where the implementation of the Spark pipelines can be observed in practice using standard image benchmarks, and downloaded for research purposes. Finally, we describe a method to evaluate retrieval quality of the ever-growing high-dimensional index of the prototype, without actually indexing a web-scale media collection.},

  abstract = {Technology development has accelerated the volume growth of complex data, such as images, videos, time series, and georeferenced data. Similarity search is a widely used approach to retrieve complex data, which aims at retrieving similar data according to intrinsic characteristics of the data. Therefore, to facilitate the retrieval of complex data using similarity searches, one needs to organize large collections of data in a way that similar data can be retrieved efficiently. Many access methods were proposed in the literature to speed up similarity data retrieval from large databases. Recently, graph-based methods have emerged as a very efficient alternative for similarity retrieval, with reports indicating those methods outperformed other non-graph-based methods in several scenarios. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous work with experimental analysis on a comprehensive number of graph-based methods using the same search algorithm and execution environment. Our main contribution is a survey on graph-based methods used for similarity searches. We present a review on graph-based methods (types of graphs and search algorithms) as well as a detailed discussion on the applicability of search algorithms (with exact or approximate answers) in each graph type. Our main focus is on static methods in metric spaces. This survey also includes an experimental evaluation of representative graphs implemented in a common platform. We evaluate the relative performance behavior of these graphs concerning the main construction and query parameters for a variety of real-world datasets. We also show results using synthetic datasets evaluating the performance of different graph types according to different dataset features. Our experimental results reinforce the tradeoff between graph construction cost and search performance according to the construction and search parameters.},
