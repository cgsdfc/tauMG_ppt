Good morning professors, I am Feng Cong, a B.Eng. of BUAA and an M.Eng. candidate of HRBUST.
Today, I am going to give a brief talk about the tauMG paper.

# frame 2 outline
Here is the outline of this talk. First, I am going to provide some background of ANNS.
Then let's look at the main idea of tauMG. Finally, it's about some personal insights that I gained from the paper
and some questions about the paper that might sound interesting.

# frame 3 the values and challenges of ANNS
So first of all, let's look at the values and challenges of ANNS, aka, the approximate nearest neighbor search.
ANNS has many applications such as information retrieval of images, documents, songs, machine learning, and recommendation systems.
So, it has many valuable applications and it is also a fundamental search technique.
And the challenges of ANNS. First, it has to face the growing size of real-world databases. Second, the curse of dimentionality causes
data sparsity in high-dimentional space. Finally, there are many tradeoffs when designing an ANNS algorithm.
For example, you have to balance search and index complexities, time and space complexities, and accuracy versus latency.

# frame 4 the problem setting and taxology of ANNS
So here is the formal definition of the ANNS problem. We have a database D of n points and a query q in the space.
And we want to efficiently find vbar, the approximate nearest neighbor of q from the database. Note that vbar does not
have to be the exact nearest neighbor. It just needs to be close enough.

And so far, these existing ANNS methods can be classified into four categories. We have tree-based methods, such as KD-tree and Ball-tree.
We also have hashing-based, quantization-based, and proximity graph-based, aka, PG-based.

# frame 5 The drawback of existing ANNS methods
However, there are some drawbacks with the existing ANNS methods.
First, let's look at the drawbacks of non PG methods.
For example, tree-based and hashing-based methods tend to scatter the neighborhood of a node into many cells,
which causes them to check more points during a search.
This figure illustrates an example where these two kinds of methods check a lot more points than the PG-based methods.

# frame 6 The drawbacks of existing ANNS methods
And for PG methods, some of them lack an error guarantee or search complexity guarantee.
Others set an impractical assumption that the query q is in the database, such as MRNG.
This figure shows a failure case of MRNG when q is not in the database.
Finally, all of the existing PG methods has a high search time complexity due to a long path length.

# frame 7 Contributions of the Ï„ -MG paper
To solve the above issues, first, the tauMG paper proved the length of any greedy routing path in a PG is big O
n to the power of 2 divided by m times log n with a great probability.
Then, a new PG called tau-MG and a corresponding greedy routing algorithm are proposed, which guarantee to find vbar in
time n to the power of m to the minus one given delta q vbar smaller than tau.
